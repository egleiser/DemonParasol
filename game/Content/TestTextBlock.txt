Hello, Setsuko. I wondered if you might find your way to my humble home. I know why you're here so please, listen closely and do not interrupt. Your mother is dying. Unless she receives a cure, she will be dead in two days time. I imagine your father has not told you this to spare your feelings; this is a mistake. If you don't know what the complete scope of your problem, how will you ever find the correct solution? Fortunately for you, you have stumbled on to the only solution that can solve your problem. I can cure your mother. It is, in fact, a trivial issue for me. Whta is not trivial is why I would help you. What can you do for me that would warrant me doing anything for you?
